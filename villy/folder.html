                ABOUT ME 
            </h3>
            <P id="sth">
                I am a girl in my "late teens" i guess. I am an enthusiast of a couple of stuff, including; personal time, space and prefer being in my ambience. 
                Mostly, this is coz i think its cosy to be in your own dimension, essentially having the dominance while at it and being the one calling the shots in whatever away from societal's views and general approach
                I'm a believer of optimism as well as general positive living.
                i'd call myself a family lover, coming from a family of six. I'm the eldest daughter and that has made me explore on a lot.
                I'm passionate on stuff i love and enjoy doing, you can call it a strong devotion.
            </P>
